# Dashboard
The student performance dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of student progress, achievements, and areas for improvement. The requirements for the dashboard were agreed upon during stakeholder interviews, and usability tests were conducted to refine the dashboard's layout and functionality. The dashboard effectively utilizes data sources to present meaningful insights, enabling students and educators to make informed decisions and implement targeted interventions to improve student performance. The feedback from usability tests played a crucial role in enhancing the dashboard's usability and ensuring it meets the needs of the stakeholder. The student performance dashboard is an invaluable tool that fosters a supportive and effective learning environment, ultimately leading to improved educational outcomes.
